# Home-Automation

In this project we operate all of the home appliances through mobile application. The home appliances can be accesed from around the worl where ever there is 
internet available and the home cercuit is connected with the Internet. If the wifi is not available for some issue, then the home appliances can be oerated through Mobile App using Blutooth 
signal. if both wifi and blutooth is not availavbe, still the home appliances can be accessed through simple buttons on the control board. Sounds really cool right!

Let's see how does this works:
1) Make the hardware connections as according to the configuration in the code.
2) The code in file "Main-Code.ino" is the code uploaded in ESP32, but the wifi name and passwords must be changed according to the available wifi.
3) We connect this setup with the Blynk App (an open source platform) through wifi, to operate the home appliances through mobile. 
4) Setup the mobile app according to the number of appliances used in the circuit.
5) your home Appliances are now accessible to you through out the Globe, where internet is available and at the same time your home is connected with the internet.
